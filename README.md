# Neighborhood Map project

To successfully run this application, simply double click on index.html and a new window or tab(if you have a
window opened already) will open with the application running in your default browser. You will see a Google map
with markers plotted onto the map. To the left you will see a side bar containing a search box, filter button,
and list of location names. You will also see a hamburger menu to the right of the sidebar. If you click on any
of the markers, the marker will bounce and an info window will open with some information of that location or
place and a clickable link of the name of the location. If you click on that link, a new tab will open to the
Wikipedia page of that location. If you enter a text into the search box, let's say "Chicago", into the search
box and click on the filter button, you will see that the list will be filtered with the locations containing
"Chicago" in the name. For this case, you will see two items in the list: Chicago Symphony Orchestra and The Art
Institute of Chicago. You will also see two markers on the map corresponding to those two locations. To reset
the list and the map, simply clear out the search box and click on the filter button. Clicking the hamburger
menu will hide/show the sidebar.
